\maketitle
The project involves the design and layout of a LDPC decoder block. After
the creation of behavioural RTL using BSV and Verilog, we have chosen to use
an open-source ASIC design flow to generate the GDS2 for the design.

\section{LDPC Background}
In communication system normally the transmitter appends parity bits to
message bits in order allow the receiver to correct or detect errors. These
are called error correcting codes. There is a generator matrix which
encapsulates the implementation of the parity check equations :
\[
C = M*G
\]

Here, C is the coded message, M is the original message and G is the generator
matrix. At the receiver side we have the received message bit and the parity
check matrix, from which we decode the message.

In LDPC codes there is a property that every code digit is contained in the
same no. of equations and each equations contains the same no. of code
symbols. LDPC codes are usually represented by the tanner graph. Tanner graph
contains two set of vertices: 
\begin{enumerate}
   \item $n$ vertices for the code word bits called a bit nodes.
   \item $m$ vertices for the check equation called check node.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Parity Matrix}
The parity matrix dictates the connections between the bit-nodes and
check-nodes and encodes a tanner graph. So, in order to build a hardware LDPC
decoder, we have to fix this parity matrix. We have chosen the following
matrix which has been provided to us by Mandar J.~Datar from the HPC Lab:

\[
H = \begin{bmatrix}
1 1 0 1 0 0 0 \\
0 1 1 0 1 0 0 \\
0 0 1 1 0 1 0 \\
0 0 0 1 1 0 1 \\
1 0 0 0 1 1 0 \\
0 1 0 0 0 1 1 \\
1 0 1 0 0 0 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

A $1$ at row $i$, column $j$ indicates a connection between $i^{th}$ checknode
and $j^{th}$ bitnode as show in figure~\ref{fig:bc}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Decoder Algorithm}
Here we used the Bit Flipping algorithm, in which the received message bits
are decoded according to the parity matrix and if the bit obtained is not
correct, then the respective bit is flipped and then again the equations are
checked. The bit flip decoder directly gives it output whenever a valid code
word has obtained which satisfies all the parity check equation.
Here the $c_1$ means the first bit of coded word is taking the input from the
$b_1$, $b_2$, $b_4$, then bit which it will send back to the $b_0$ is:

\[
   c_1 = b_1 \oplus b_2 \oplus b_4
\]
\[
   c_2 = b_2 \oplus b_3 \oplus b_5
\]

These are sent back to the respective bitnodes. For instance bitnode-1 will
receive inputs from checknodes 1, 6 and 7 and so on. Now, the bit assigned to
the b1 is the majority of the bits which are send by the c1, c6 and c7.

Like this all the bits have one value assigned to them, now to check whether
the decoded messages bits are correct or not all the parity equations should
be checked using:
\[
   (b_1 \oplus b_2 \oplus b_4) \vee (b_2 \oplus b3 \oplus b5) \vee (b3 \oplus
   b4 \oplus b6) \vee (b4 \oplus b5 \oplus b7) \vee (b1 \oplus b5 \oplus b6)
   \vee (b2 \oplus b6 \oplus b7) \vee (b1 \oplus b3 \oplus b7)
\]
If the output of the above equation is zero means the decoded message bits are
correct otherwise, it will again send the bit obtained to the check nodes and
again do the calculations until the result of the equation is zero.

\section{LDPC Decoder Block Diagram}
The LDPC decoder core represents the design which was developed and
implemented upto GDSII. The LDPC decoder top-level represents the top-level
for functional verification on a DE-Nano FPGA board using Quartus. For
verification the LDPC decoder core was integrated as a NIOS peripheral with an
Avalon slave interface.

\begin{figure}[hbt]

\end{figure}

Appendix A describes in detail how the RTL design of the LDPC core and its
components were carried out. The design is hierarchical:

\end{figure}

\section{From RTL to GDSII}
In the course of the project we experimented with two different design flows
to realise a circuit for the LDPC decoder. The starting point of both flows
was after the design had been sufficiently verified through functional
simulations as well as by running as an Avalon slave on the DE-Nano board.

\subsection{Bottom-up Flow Using Java Electric}

Figure~\ref{fig:flow1} captures the steps involved in a bottom-up flow using
the Electric tool-flow introduced as part of the course:

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{FLOW1.jpg}
\label{fig:flow}
\caption{Flow using Java Electric}
\end{figure}

The Yosys synthesis tool reads in behavioural RTL and generates a structural
netlist, given a cell library. The tool uses the abc tool in the background to
actually do the synthesis. 

The structural RTL is then converted to structural VHDL. This step usually
involved running multiple scripts to get it into just the correct format for
input to the Electric tool suite.

In the bottom-up flow we begin at the lowest level of the hierarchy,
individually, synthesizing, and then creating layouts and schematic for each
module. Each individual module is taken through DRC and LVS.

As the leaf module got bigger, manual schematic entry became problemmatic. So
we decided to carry out LVS by comparing the spice netlist dumped from the
layout versus the spice netlist created by Yosys. 

Java Electric was not able to check DRC on the complete design repeatedly
crashing after a few hours of running DRC. 

\subsubsection{Manual stitching in Electric}
We have used electric 9.07 using bottom-up appraoch for creating layout out of
the VHDL files. It has created layout for each node with successful design
rule check(DRC) and earlier the plan was to make layout for individual module
and then make layout manually for the overall LDPC decoder using these
individual module. But the layouts for the individual modules were quite big
and creating layout for the whole circuit using those big layout became
extremely difficult. We are using 7 bitnodes and 7 checknodes and for
each node there is an individual layout means 14 layouts only for these
bitnodes and checknodes, leaving other nodes aside. This was becoming
something which was going out of reach for the mannual layout.

Then we decided to combine all the vhdl code files for respective modules in
the vhdl code file of the top level circuit and tried to generate the
automatic layout from electric 9.07. We have tried to make changes in the
placement settings,routing settings and to use metal layers more than 2 but
electric remains unresponsive and creating layout with the default settings.
But there was a problem in running DRC for this top level circuit layout
because it was taking too long to complete the DRC and still not displaying
the results/errors.To solve this problem we decided to shift towards Qflow
open circuit design tool.

\subsection{Top-down Flow Using Q-Flow}
The limitations with DRC on Java Electric led us to explore an alternate
design flow. For this we settled on a top-down flow called qflow, which
integrates a set of open-source tools. In this flow we have to explicitly do
placement and routing - it is not integrated under a single tool like Java
Electric. On the other hand, this flow has complete PDKs for 350nm and 180nm
processes which makes it possible to generate a GDS-II.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{FLOW2.jpg}
\label{fig:flow-q}
\caption{Flow using QFlow}
\end{figure}

The other big difference from the Electric based flow is the use of a top-down
approach where the whole LDPC core is flattened allowing the place and route
tool greater flexibility. We also did try a bottom-up approach with this flow,
but it resulted in several DRC violations at the top-level which we haven't
yet managed to debug.

The QFlow based flow also integrates static timing analysis -- something which
was missing on the Electric based flow. 

\section{Results}
These results were obtained using OSU's 350nm PDK. A hierarchical layout and
flat layout are contrasted on figure~\ref{fig:routes}. The flat layout is
clearly superior in terms of timing and area due to the much higher compaction
obtained by automatic layout.

From our bottom-up synthesis of the bitnode and checknode, the pre and
post-layout maximum operating frequencies are:

\begin{description}
   \item[mkBitNode:] 535.41 MHz, 533 MHz
   \item[mkChkNode:] 481.60 MHz, 479.11 MHz
\end{description}
