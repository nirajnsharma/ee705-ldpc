\maketitle
The project involves the design and layout of a LDPC decoder block. After
the creation of behavioural RTL we have chosen to use an open-source tool
based design flow to generate the GDS2 for the design.

\section{Block Diagram}
The LDPC decoder core represents the design which will be developed and
implemented upto GDS2. The LDPC decoder top-level represents the top-level
for functional verification on a Nano FPGA board using Quartus.

\section{Current Status and Plan Ahead}
The design of the behavioural verilog for the decoder is nearly complete. The
remaining steps are described below:
\begin{center}
   \begin{tabular}{lll}
      \hline
      Task & Tool & Status\\
      \hline
      Functional Verification & Quartus & Ongoing\\
      Synthesis to Gate level & Yosys & Ongoing\\
      CTS and STA & ?? & TBD\\
      Layout & Java Electric & TBD\\
      \hline
   \end{tabular}
\end{center}

The rest of the document describes the RTL design of the LDPC Core and its
components.
